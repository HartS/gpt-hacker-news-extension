To write a browser extension for Chrome, you'll need to have some experience with web development and be familiar with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a general outline of the steps you'll need to take to create the extension you've described:

1. Create a new folder on your computer and give it a name that reflects the purpose of your extension. For example, "hacker-news-extension" would be a good name.

2. Inside this folder, create a file called "manifest.json" and add the following code to it:

{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Hacker News Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://news.ycombinator.com/*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "icon.png",
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}

This code defines the basic properties of your extension, such as its name and version number, as well as which scripts will be injected into pages that match the specified URL pattern (in this case, any page on Hacker News). It also specifies that your extension will have access to the browser's storage API, which you'll use to keep track of which comments you've already seen.

3. Create an icon for your extension and save it as "icon.png" in the same folder. This icon will be displayed in the Chrome toolbar when your extension is installed.

4. Create a file called "popup.html" in the same folder, and add the following code to it:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hacker News Extension</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hacker News Extension</h1>
    <p>This extension highlights new comments on Hacker News.</p>
  </body>
</html>

This file defines the HTML content that will be displayed when the user clicks on the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar. You can customize this content to include any information or instructions you want to provide to the user.

5. Create a file called "content-script.js" in the same folder, and add the following code to it:

// Get the current URL of the page
var currentURL = window.location.href;

// Check if the current URL is a comment thread on Hacker News
if (currentURL.indexOf("item?id=") !== -1) {
  // Get the ID of the comment thread from the URL
  var threadID = currentURL.split("=")[1];

  // Check if the user has already visited this thread
  if (localStorage.getItem(threadID) === null) {
    // If not, set the local storage item for this thread to the current date
    localStorage.setItem(threadID, Date.now());
  } else {
    // If the user has visited the thread before, get the timestamp of the last visit
    var lastVisit = localStorage.getItem(threadID);

    // Loop through all the comments on the page
    var comments = document.querySelect

6. To test your extension, open Chrome and go to the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/).

7. Enable the "Developer mode" option at the top of the page.

8. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder that contains your extension files. This will install your extension in Chrome.

9. Open Hacker News and navigate to a comment thread. You should see your extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar.

10. Click on the extension's icon to open the popup window and verify that the content is displayed correctly.

11. To test the highlighting of new comments, refresh the comment thread page and verify that any comments that were not visible the last time you visited the thread are now highlighted.

12. If you encounter any issues or want to make further changes to your extension, you can edit the extension files and reload the extension by clicking on the "Reload" button next to your extension on the Extensions page.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.


Sure, here is the complete code for the content-script.js file:

// Get the current URL of the page
var currentURL = window.location.href;

// Check if the current URL is a comment thread on Hacker News
if (currentURL.indexOf("item?id=") !== -1) {
  // Get the ID of the comment thread from the URL
  var threadID = currentURL.split("=")[1];

  // Check if the user has already visited this thread
  if (localStorage.getItem(threadID) === null) {
    // If not, set the local storage item for this thread to the current date
    localStorage.setItem(threadID, Date.now());
  } else {
    // If the user has visited the thread before, get the timestamp of the last visit
    var lastVisit = localStorage.getItem(threadID);

    // Loop through all the comments on the page
    var comments = document.querySelectorAll(".comment-tree .comtr");
    for (var i = 0; i < comments.length; i++) {
      // Get the timestamp of the comment
      var commentTime = comments[i].querySelector(".age a").getAttribute("title");
      commentTime = new Date(commentTime).getTime();

      // If the comment was posted after the user's last visit, highlight it
      if (commentTime > lastVisit) {
        comments[i].style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
      }
    }
  }
}

This code checks if the current page is a comment thread on Hacker News, and if so, it checks the local storage to see if the user has visited this thread before. If the user hasn't visited the thread before, it sets the local storage item for this thread to the current date. If the user has visited the thread before, it loops through all the comments on the page and checks the timestamp of each comment. If a comment was posted after the user's last visit to the thread, it highlights the comment by setting its background color to yellow.

The code that I provided should work with manifest version 3, but there may be some slight differences in how the manifest file is structured. In manifest version 3, the "content_scripts" section is replaced by the "content_scripts" key, and the "matches" and "js" keys are moved inside the "content_scripts" array. Here is an example of how the manifest file would look in manifest version 3:

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Hacker News Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://news.ycombinator.com/*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "icon.png",
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}

You can find more information about the manifest file in manifest version 3 in the Chrome Extension Developer Guide.

The error message indicates that the "browser_action" key is not supported in manifest version 3, which is the version of the manifest file that you are using. In manifest version 3, the "browser_action" key is replaced by the "browser_action" property, which has a similar structure but uses different keys and values.

Here is an example of how the "browser_action" property would look in manifest version 3:

"browser_action": {
  "default_title": "Hacker News Extension",
  "default_popup": "popup.html"
}

To fix the error, you can update the manifest file to use the "browser_action" property instead of the "browser_action" key, and update the keys and values according to the example above.

Alternatively, you can switch to using manifest version 2 by changing the "manifest_version" value in the manifest file from 3 to 2. This will allow you to use the "browser_action" key in the manifest file, and the extension should load without any errors.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Yes, you can use the terminal to create a basic icon.png file that will work with your extension. You can use the touch command to create an empty file called "icon.png" in the extension's folder, like this:

touch icon.png

This will create a file called "icon.png" in the current directory, which you can then use as the default icon for your extension.

Alternatively, you can use the curl command to download an image from the web and save it as "icon.png" in the extension's folder. For example, if you want to use the Hacker News logo as the extension's icon, you can run the following command:

curl https://news.ycombinator.com/favicon.ico -o icon.png

This will download the Hacker News favicon from the web and save it as "icon.png" in the current directory.

To debug the content script, you can use the Chrome DevTools to inspect the page and see what's happening when the script is injected. Here's how you can do this:

1. Open the comment thread page on Hacker News where you want to test the content script.

2. Open the Chrome DevTools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" from the context menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Cmd+Opt+I (macOS).

3. In the DevTools window, go to the "Sources" tab and expand the "Content scripts" section on the left.

4. You should see the "content-script.js" file listed here. Click on it to open the script in the editor pane.

5. You can now add breakpoints to the script by clicking on the line numbers on the left side of the editor pane. This will pause the script execution at the specified line, allowing you to inspect the page and see the values of variables and expressions at that point in the script.

6. To test the content script, refresh the comment thread page and the script should be injected into the page. The DevTools will pause at the first breakpoint that you set, and you can step through the script line by line to see what's happening.

7. As you step through the script, you can use the DevTools to inspect the page and see how the script is interacting with the page. For example, you can use the "Elements" tab to see the HTML structure of the page, and the "Console" tab to see any error messages or log output from the script.

8. You can also use the "Sources" tab to see the values of variables and expressions in the script, and you can use the "Watch" pane to watch specific variables and expressions as the script runs.
